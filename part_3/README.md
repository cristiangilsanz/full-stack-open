# Part 3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.

## Phonebook Application  

In this part, I built a backend for my phonebook application using Node.js and Express.js. The backend is connected to a MongoDB database to store application data and is deployed on Fly.io. It provides a REST API that allows CRUD operations and also serves the React frontend I developed in Part 2.
